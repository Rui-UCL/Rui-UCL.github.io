*As new technologies and digitalisation transform the way we engage with the world, it has also led to a revolution in the built environment and the rise of smart buildings and digital engineering.*

The recent revolution in digital technology and cyber-physical systems has the potential to reduce costs and overcome barriers to energy efficiency through advanced control and operation of building HVAC systems. Digitalisation has had a transformative impact in many areas. The Smart Buildings and Digital Engineering theme seeks to envisage how digitalisation changes how built assets are designed, constructed and operated.

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides access to more diverse, low-cost data on the status and activity of equipment and people in buildings. Artificial intelligence and data analytics; enable more comprehensive energy performance assessment and predictive management of assets. Collaborative design and project delivery platforms enable new opportunities for collaboration and multi-stakeholder interaction to achieve improved design and outcomes.

The activities within the Smart Buildings and Digital Engineering theme seek to understand and explore the potential of applying these technologies and how these technologies can be used to create better quality outcomes for end-users and all stakeholders.

The International Energy Agency highlighted in the 2019 Energy Efficiency report the role that digitalisation will have in the built environment; the concept of digitalisation is explained as “the increasing interaction and convergence between the digital and physical worlds” where “the digital world has three fundamental elements:  data, analytics, connectivity”.
