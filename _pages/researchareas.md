The theme explores the tools and methods to develop and deliver data-driven smart buildings. We understand a data-driven smart building in line with the definition given by IEA Annex 81:
‘A building that uses digitalisation technologies to dynamically optimise its operation, where optimisation objectives typically relate to site energy use, IEQ, and occupant experience. Ideally, it is sufficiently connected and integrated with markets and processes to respond to externalities adaptively and changing conditions (e.g. weather, electricity prices, energy supply constraints, equipment maintenance, etc.). Ideally, it has sufficient memory of past events and the ability to anticipate future impacts, and it can select an informed course of action for achieving higher-level objectives – reminiscent of human intelligence. To achieve this vision, a Data-Driven Smart Building utilises live and historical data from relevant sensors, IoT equipment, mobile devices, and other sources to provide situational awareness for informed decision-making. Achieving the optimisation objectives will often benefit from advanced supervisory-level automation, driven by computational analysis (e.g. Machine Learning, AI, etc.) applied to available data.’
